            <h2> Alumni - Yala Old Boys Association (YOBA)</h2> 
            <p> Yala Old Boys Association is a social gathering of St. Mary's School Yala's Alumni and was established in 1955 
                primarily so they can network and exchange ideas. YOBA also offers support to the school in various projects. 
                A few of them have been very supportive and the school encourages others to come back "home" so that together 
                we may take St. Mary's School Yala to greater heights.
