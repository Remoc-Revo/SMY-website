                    The world of books is the most remarkable creation of man. Nothing else he builds ever lasts. Monuments fall, 
                    nations perish, and civilizations grow old and die out. After an era of darkness, new races build others. 
                    But in the world of books are volumes that live on still as young and fresh as the day they were written, 
                    still telling stories of men's hearts of the hearts of men centuries dead.<br><br>

                    This is the one thing that has come out of the students of this great school. They are focused, 
                    determined and driven by the audacity of success amid the odds and the difficulties that pertain 
                    their struggle. They have set their priorities right and said that reading and working smarter 
                    are the way out of ignorance and the road to achievement.<br><br>

                    They are always driven by this great motto: “SHINE IN EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE”<br><br>
                    - Gordon Ochieng Okello, Student's Council Chairman, 2009-2010
