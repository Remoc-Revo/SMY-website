        <h3>The Establishment of St. Mary's School Yala by the Mill Hill Missionaries in Kenya</h3>

        European missionaries came into Kenya in the late 19th and early 20th centuries primarily
        to evangelise and spread Christianity to the indigenous African population. Missionaries soon
        realised that evangelising; which required knowledge of reading of the bible and catechism
        instruction, would only be possible by provision of basic formal education. Hence the 
        provision of this basic education began in various mission stations across the country 
        in form of bush schools and later, primary schools. <br><br>The beginning of mission secondary 
        schools in Kenya was however a result of competition between the various missionaries 
        in the country to; gain more converts into their faith, keep the converts they already 
        had, and to have expanded space in the hierarchies of the colonial administration. This
        article will thus highlight this missionary rivalry and the subsequent development of 
        St. Mary School Yala, a secondary school that was began in Western Kenya by the Roman 
        Catholic Mill Hill Missionaries.
