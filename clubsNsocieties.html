                <h3>Equipping students with knowledge about what to do in the event of a disaster is critical to saving lives</h3>
                <p>In a bid to increase safety in disaster-prone schools, St John Ambulance making efforts to improve safety 
                    of learners through their Cadet and Dolphin programs.<br><br>

                    in secondary level.<br><br>

                     representing a 30 percent increase.<br><br>

                    reach out to schools an important one.<br><br>

                      learning.<br><br>

                     In 2001, 68 boys were burnt to death in Kyanguli Secondary School fire in Machakos. In the same year, in Bombolulu Girls at 
                     the Coast, 58 children died in a dormitory fire.
                    
                    Therefore, this club plays a very important role in the school,ensuring that lives will be saved in case of any accident.
